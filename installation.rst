It is possible to simply copy the folder vb_toobox to your project folder and proceed from there. If this is the case, be sure you have the following packages installed

	multiprocess
	nibabel
	numpy
	scipy
	pillow
	psutil
	The preferred way to install is through pip. It is as easy as

	pip install vb_toolbox
	If your pip is properly configured, you can now use the program vb_tool from your command line, and import any of the submodules in the vb_toolbox in your python interpreter.
